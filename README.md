Calculator
==========

This is a JavaScript-powered mathematical calculator completed as part of [Free Code Camp's](freecodecamp.com) Front End 
Certificate program. I've since learned that JavaScript calculators are popular tutorial subjects but I built this one from
scratch and, having just read JavaScript: The Good Parts at the time, without eval. Try it out at my [portfolio website]
(http://funmiojo.com/calculator/calculator.html).

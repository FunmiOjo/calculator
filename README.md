Calculator
==========

This is a JavaScript-powered mathematical calculator completed as part of [Free Code Camp's](freecodecamp.com) Front End 
Certificate program. It uses a function from the [Math.js](http://mathjs.org/) library to avoid floating point rounding errors. Try it out at my [portfolio website](http://funmiojo.com/calculator/calculator.html).
